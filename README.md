# COMP472_Assignment2
Python program that uses different pre-trained models and our own made model to answer the Synonym Test automatically. Simply run the code to genrate outputs assuming the datasets are present in the project. 


To train our model we used 16 textbooks with enrich vocabulary for better results in prediction. 
In the below image, the first four models were pre-trained models and the rest were our own models trained from same corpus but with different embedding sizes to analyze the results effectively.
